Climate Lobe Project Data, Scripts, and Plotting

CL_Lobe_ESN.py:  Scripts for the vary-lobe experiment, ESN models
CL_Lobe_D2R2.py: Scripts for the vary-lobe experiment, D2R2 model
CL_Rho_ESN.py:   Scripts for the vary-rho experiment, ESN models
CL_Rho_D2R2.py:  Scripts for the vary-rho experiment, D2R2 model

CL_Plots.py: Script for generating plots using included data. 

Data can also be regenerated using the scripts. Some plots are directly created by the scripts (e.g. example trajectories for single runs), while most aggregate plots are created by the CL_Plots.py script.
